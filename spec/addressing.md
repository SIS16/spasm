# 16-bit Addressing Modes

Instructions that accept a source and/or a destination can accept values using several addressing modes.
This document outlines all the possible addressing modes for 16-bit instructions.

## Examples

In the following example code, instructions prefixed with `!` are illegal and will not assemble.

```asm
    ; Raw moves
    mov $F354, %ax               ; Copy 16-bit value in %ax to mem address $F354-F355
    mov %ax, $F354               ; Copy 16-bit value in mem addresses $F354-F355 to %ax
    mov %ax, #$F354              ; Copy immediate 16-bit value #$F354 to %ax
    mov %ax, %bx                 ; Copy 16-bit value in %bx to %ax
    mov $F354, #69               ; Copy 16-bit immediate #69 to mem address $F354-F355

    ; Dereferencing pointers
    mov [$F354], %ax             ; Copy 16-bit value in %ax to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in $F354-F355
  ! mov $F354,   [%ax]           ; (Illegal Mem->Mem) Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in %ax to the mem address $F354-F355
  ! mov [$F354], [%ax]           ; (Illegal Mem->Mem) Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in %ax to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in $F354-F355

  ! mov [%ax], $F354             ; (Illegal Mem->Mem) Copy 16-bit value in mem addresses $F354-F355 to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in %ax
    mov %ax,   [$F354]           ; Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in mem addresses $F354-F355 to %ax
  ! mov [%ax], [$F354]           ; (Illegal Mem->Mem) Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in mem addresses $F354-F355 to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in %ax

    mov [%ax], #$F354            ; Copy immediate 16-bit value #$F354 to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer %ax
  ! mov %ax, [#$F354]            ; (Illegal - Cannot dereference an immediate)
  ! mov [%ax], [#$F354]          ; (Illegal - Cannot dereference an immediate)

    mov [%ax], %bx               ; Copy 16-bit value in %bx to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in %ax
    mov %ax, [%bx]               ; Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in %bx to %ax
  ! mov [%ax], [%bx]             ; (Illegal Mem->Mem) Copy 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in %bx to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in %ax

    mov [$F354], #69             ; Copy 16-bit immediate #69 to the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer in $F354-F355
  ! mov $F354, [#69]             ; (Illegal - Cannot dereference an immediate)
  ! mov [$F354], [#69]           ; (Illegal - Cannot dereference an immediate)

  ! mov label, #$69              ; (Illegal - Write to ROM address) Copy the 16-bit immediate #$69 into the address of the label
    mov [label], #$69            ; (Dangerous if label does contain a valid ram address) Copy the 16-bit immediate #$69 into the mem address stored as a 16-bit pointer at the labels address in rom
    mov %ax, label               ; Copy the 16-bit rom address of the label into %ax
    mov %ax, [label]             ; Copy the 16-bit value at the pointer address stored in address of the label into %ax

    mov [%sp + 2], #$F354        ; Copy immediate 16-bit value #$F354 to the mem address computed by adding 2 to the stack pointer (%sp)
    mov [%sp + %ax * 2], #$F354  ; Copy immediate 16-bit value #$F354 to the mem address computed by adding 2 multiplied by the value in %ax to the stack pointer (%sp)
```

## Encoding

The addressing mode for an instruction is encoded as 2 nibbles of 4 bits.
The high nibble describes the addressing mode for the first parameter (dest) and the low nibble describes the addressing mode for the second parameter (src).

### Bits of addressing mode nibble

4 - Addressing Mode (0 for direct, 1 for indirect)
3 - Value type (0 for constant, 1 for register)

If direct and constant:
2 - Constant Type (0 for memorty address, 1 for immediate)

Else: (indirect constant is assumed to be memory address)
2-1 - Indirect addressing mode:
00 = Only base
01 = Base and constant offset
10 = Base and register offset
11 = Base and scaled register offset
